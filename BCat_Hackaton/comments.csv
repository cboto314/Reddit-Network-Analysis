Something traumatic happened to me as well when I was 19, a few months before I started college. I dropped out of college 2 years later and didn’t finish my degree. I was depressed and traumatized as hell and couldn’t pretend any longer that i am okay. What helped me was to find a therapist and a few months later I had the strength to start a new degree in management and pushed through. 
I got my bachelors degree, was able to intern in two prestigious companies where the latter even offered me a job. Despite this I am sometimes sad that my peers have already finished with their master degrees and / or started working already while it took me some time. 
A few months ago I declined a masters degree from a top European business school to take a break before starting my masters. I’m going weekly  to therapy and work part-time at my new job and moved back to my parents. I just needed that break and I know that despite the first therapy that my mental health isn’t exactly there where it needs to be and I still have some issues I need to work on. 

What I am trying to say is that breaks are OK, and baby steps are OK as well. Life is not linear. The most important thing is that you work on it and get the help you need. It’s never too late to start a degree or to pursue your dreams. 
When you are young it always feels like bad things that happen to us feel like the end of the world but it’s not true. Life offers us so many chances, there’s always a new beginning, a new career no matter how old you are or what happened to you. :)",201783facf4fe7418f4aacc431cf70e27cf09adf,True,False,,,,,0,1640073834,,0,{},hpeh976,False,t3_rl5oze,False,True,t3_rl5oze,/r/FemaleLevelUpStrategy/comments/rl5oze/i_need_advice_on_how_to_cope_with_not_being_where/hpeh976/,1640073844,1,False,True,False,FemaleLevelUpStrategy,t5_2c0k6s,r/FemaleLevelUpStrategy,public,,0,[],

I wanted to set a few different goals based on the wheel of life assessment (where you evaluate different  areas of your life and how satisfied you are with them). 

Mine are:

Financial: Save a fully-funded 6 month emergency fund (topping up what I have already by about 2000)

Personal Development: Write one short story a month and look for opportunities to get them published.

Career: Do one hour of reading or online courses per week to improve my skills.

Health: Get into the habit of working out 3-4x a week and taking 10000 steps a day. 

Environment: Keep making home improvements and aim to have all rooms in my house repainted by the end of the year. 

Family, Friends and Relationship: Plan more days out, dates and meet-ups (at least one a month for each group) and take more photos!",65b5e4467c3dbbea21eba26d3d93765a551fe689,True,False,,,,,0,1640073390,,0,{},hpegpit,False,t3_rkv8t9,False,True,t3_rkv8t9,/r/FemaleLevelUpStrategy/comments/rkv8t9/goals_for_2022/hpegpit/,1640073401,1,False,True,False,FemaleLevelUpStrategy,t5_2c0k6s,r/FemaleLevelUpStrategy,public,,0,[],
