YOU HAVE THEM FOR A REASON. but revisit them. 

until i did the work to unpack it, i used to think that my ideal man was a rich, tall, older man. 

it took me way too long to learn that i had brainwashed myself into a riptide that led me straight to LVM island by following my own standards. 

and it was all because of words. (words can be almost spellbinding when you repeat them to yourself enough). i had all the wrong words. 

**i was convinced that i wanted someone RICH. when all along what i really wanted was a man who is COMPETENT.** 

take it from someone who learned the hard way: rich men who acquire their money through luck, fortune or ruthlessness can be just as LV (or much worse) as men who are broke. a teacher making 40 thousand a year (but is competent) might be a better match for you than a finance bro who makes a lot but bungles everything in his personal life. 

**i thought i liked TALL men. turns out i just like men who are SECURE** with their masculinity and self esteem. 

many short men are insecure and have (repulsive) inferiority complexes. in response, i mistakenly put tall men on a pedestal *that they didn't deserve to be on*. my ex was a tall man who exclusively dated short women until he met me. which is suspicious to say the least and should have been a red flag. but i still put him up there on that pedestal because he was tall. blind spot. it took a long time for his inferiority complex to surface. but it was there, so it eventually did. he was attracted to my femininity and used me to feel more manly about himself (just like how he used short women to feel big in the past) but he was insecure about his masculinity. once i saw that for what it was, the novelty of his height wore off FAST. short men who aren't insecure are more attractive (to me) than LVM who are tall.

and now my biggest error: **i honestly thought i liked OLDER men.** what a nightmare. all along what i was actually attracted to was men who are **CONSISTENT** (older people, in general are more consistent just by default) **and EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT**

hard lesson learned: the type of men who date younger women are not emotionally intelligent at all. in fact, they are the most stunted. they've just taken the manipulation short cut because they're inferior to their peers. they are the worst of the worst. 

my point is this: don't choose men while you're in autopilot. get to know yourself first. you may think you have high standards and that's good enough. but you might need to put in way more work. raising the bar and having standards is a good first step. but keep going. 

write out a list of things you find attractive in men and then sit with it. REALLY examine each one. explain to yourself WHY you find those qualities attractive. this sub preaches a lot about being brutally honest with the word about what you want. but be brutually honest with YOURSELF first. unpack your shit! 

here's a few more examples: 

i used to think i wanted someone with **talent**. now i've learned i just like men who have **hobbies** and interests. 

i used to think i liked men who **spent a lot** on dates. now i know i just wanted a man who **put in effort.**",True,False,False,FemaleDatingStrategy,t5_xaiot,195956,public,confidence,self,"having and defining your own standards is a great first step, but keep going!!! don't stop there.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/q41iu5/having_and_defining_your_own_standards_is_a_great/,some_ads,7,,,,,,#24a0ed,abcb97fa-f8df-11e9-b9c6-0ede9112c558,dark

I understand that many members do not want to hear from conservative women, I really do. I myself am not conservative, but, as Andrea Dworkin states, as women we need to come together as a class, not separate off into fringe groups. Keeping us polarised and separate is one of the ways that the patriarchy has kept us down. If we refuse to interact with women who hold political views that are different to ours then we will never achieve women’s liberation. I’m not saying you have to engage with women who are racist, homophobic, handmaidens, etc., but you shouldn’t flat out refuse to allow conservative women to participate on FDS. 

The mods have stated that being bipartisan is an important element of ensuring FDS continues to grow and reach as many women as possible. We cannot just pretend that conservative women don't exist, and I say that as a socialist. I would also be wary of being so black and white about the Left and the Right. The world is bigger than America and, in my country at least (UK), the Labour party (UK version of Democrats) is currently supporting some extremely anti-woman legislation which means I simply cannot support them currently. Biden is also no feminist.

It’s important to remember that the mods literally receive rape and death threats constantly. Reaux, Savannah and Lilith were mentioned in an incel manifesto about bringing womankind down. They literally risk their personal safety by being on the pod. We cannot afford to forget how much the mods contribute to and sacrifice for FDS.

I’ve also seen a recent post accusing the mods of removing and downvoting posts they don’t agree with and lots of people saying this is unacceptable, yet a lot of you were doing the same thing under the podcast post? One user got downvoted tons literally just for saying that, like Elle, she had gotten married young and joined the army due to financial reasons. Another user claimed that Elle had been purposely ambiguous about whether she supports abortion rights, and when Lilith corrected the user and confirmed that Elle had specifically stated that she is pro-abortion, Lilith again got downvoted tons just for stating a fact. 

I agree that healthy criticism is important, but please can we remember that the mods know what they’re doing. They are an incredible team of women and it is not for FDS users to demand that the mods do things a certain way – remember that as members we do not own this space, and if at the end of the day you fundamentally disagree with a direction the mods have decided to take FDS in then you can leave, but you cannot dictate the way they run this sub. Perhaps volunteer to be a mod if you feel so strongly about influencing FDS, though I personally think a lot of members wouldn’t be so quick to make demands if they experienced for themselves how difficult the job of being an FDS mod is. 

The mods have already shown that they are open to feedback – this is why we have Meme Free Mondays. Perhaps give them a beat to iron out the political podcast before attacking it? I don’t agree with everything the mods do either, for example, I too am not a fan of the Pickmeisha flair, but I don’t presume I have more of a right to control the direction that FDS goes in than the actual mods do. 

We can disagree, we can have different opinions, and we can critically discuss whether we think an action the mods take is in the best interests of FDS, but members demanding that the mods act a certain way are putting a strain on this movement. The greatest threat to a movement is the people inside it, please don’t let FDS be brought down by in-house disputes. People are welcome to downvote this post, like I said, I welcome polite disagreement. But I hope the mods know how much many members here appreciate them and all they do.

Not the most articulate post and I fear I’ve repeated myself quite a bit, but I hope the sentiment is there. 

P.S. I really recommend that people read ‘Right-Wing Women’ by Andrea Dworkin.

Partly inspired by the recent posts here about therapists and ADHD, I've decided it's high time I started figuring out my issues. I've had one therapy session before that was extremely unhelpful, with a young male therapist, and it turned me off the entire thing though it did prove to me how badly I need help. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past, but I'm starting to think my actual issue may be unaddressed ADHD and misogyny-motivated childhood emotional trauma.

1. I've seen advice here to select a female therapist, but are there other things to look for in terms of the therapist's own identity? Religiosity, immigrant status, etc? Should I try to find one from the same country as me who might know some of the nuances of the cultural misogyny? Or is that a bad idea as they may be mired in it too?
2. What kind of specializations may or may not be applicable? I have such longstanding issues with my family that I'm wondering if a family therapist may be able to help me more.
3. I'm exhausted and the idea of any kind of therapy classified as ""work"" is pretty overwhelming. I believe in CBT but at this point is just feels like another task I don't have the energy or motivation for. I don't know what I should be looking for in this regard. Both tough love and radical acceptance feel wrong. Are there specific questions I can ask to gauge a therapists style?
4. It is pretty hard to find a therapist taking new clients in my area, either privately or through my insurance provider, but at this point I'm willing to pay out of pocket for the right person. What should I be expecting to pay, and whats a good session frequency to start with?

So, when he finally figured out I cut him off (it took him a while), he started screaming at my mom, my other relatives how it was all their fault, they spread lies about him bla bla. He was on the edge of a heart attack but refused to go to the hospital.

This just infuriates me so much!!! He still thinks it’s other people’s fault for not covering up for him!!! Enabling his abuse, and lying to keep his image. Now, my sister is saying how I should just reach out so he wouldn’t be taking it out on them.

I finally blocked him in January 2021 without saying a word to him explaining why. 

He lives back in my home country with the rest of my family. I moved across the ocean mostly to be as far away from him as possible. 

I was able to keep minimal contact with him and ignore the fact he physically, mentally, and verbally abused me my entire childhood, until my younger sister (who still lived with them) started going through the same. She had absolute nerve breakdown at one point (January 2021), I got her out of there, blocked him and never spoke to him.

My older sister has tried to get me to unblock him because FaMiLy and he’s been heaving health issues. I refuse to even discuss anything about him.

So, when he finally figured out I cut him off (it took him a while), he started screaming at my mom, my other relatives how it was all their fault, they spread lies about him bla bla. He was on the edge of a heart attack but refused to go to the hospital.

This just infuriates me so much!!! He still thinks it’s other people’s fault for not covering up for him!!! Enabling his abuse, and lying to keep his image. Now, my sister is saying how I should just reach out so he wouldn’t be taking it out on them.

You spend months and maybe years thinking about someone and then one day a switch flips and you don't feel that way anymore? It might not even be anything the person did or said. It's just that one day for whatever reason the feelings just disappear. One day it would make you so happy just to catch a glimpse of this person, the next you are kind of indifferent.

&amp;#x200B;

It's such a mindfuck. Especially if the person treated you badly. It makes you wonder if they've damaged you and now you don't feel anything. I never had am attraction that worked out and every time this happens I just get colder and more jaded. Not just about romance but anything really, sometimes I just don't feel anything and just go through the motions, all I feel is a combination of anger, boredom and indifference. I'm not the type to go out of my way to gratuitously hurt other people but I feel that as I get older the less empathy I feel in general. These unhealthy crushes are one of the only things that lift this boredom and thats not a good thing.

Like, I don't know, more and more I feel that my body is moving and my mouth is talking and my face is making expressions but im somewhere else not really paying attention. Its not in a traumatic dissociative way, im just in autopilot.

I dont think I am depressed but I am not in the healthiest place either. Im working on that but it will still be some time until i see significant changes.

You spend months and maybe years thinking about someone and then one day a switch flips and you don't feel that way anymore? It might not even be anything the person did or said. It's just that one day for whatever reason the feelings just disappear. One day it would make you so happy just to catch a glimpse of this person, the next you are kind of indifferent.

&amp;#x200B;

It's such a mindfuck. Especially if the person treated you badly. It makes you wonder if they've damaged you and now you don't feel anything. I never had am attraction that worked out and every time this happens I just get colder and more jaded. Not just about romance but anything really, sometimes I just don't feel anything and just go through the motions, all I feel is a combination of anger, boredom and indifference. I'm not the type to go out of my way to gratuitously hurt other people but I feel that as I get older the less empathy I feel in general. These unhealthy crushes are one of the only things that lift this boredom and thats not a good thing.

Like, I don't know, more and more I feel that my body is moving and my mouth is talking and my face is making expressions but im somewhere else not really paying attention. Its not in a traumatic dissociative way, im just in autopilot.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think I am depressed but I am not in the healthiest place either. Im working on that but it will still be some time until i see significant changes.

YOU HAVE THEM FOR A REASON. but revisit them. 

until i did the work to unpack it, i used to think that my ideal man was a rich, tall, older man. 

it took me way too long to learn that i had brainwashed myself into a riptide that led me straight to LVM island by following my own standards. 

and it was all because of words. (words can be almost spellbinding when you repeat them to yourself enough). i had all the wrong words. 

**i was convinced that i wanted someone RICH. when all along what i really wanted was a man who is COMPETENT.** 

take it from someone who learned the hard way: rich men who acquire their money through luck, fortune or ruthlessness can be just as LV (or much worse) as men who are broke. a teacher making 40 thousand a year (but is competent) might be a better match for you than a finance bro who makes a lot but bungles everything in his personal life. 

**i thought i liked TALL men. turns out i just like men who are SECURE** with their masculinity and self esteem. 

many short men are insecure and have (repulsive) inferiority complexes. in response, i mistakenly put tall men on a pedestal *that they didn't deserve to be on*. my ex was a tall man who exclusively dated short women until he met me. which is suspicious to say the least and should have been a red flag. but i still put him up there on that pedestal because he was tall. blind spot. it took a long time for his inferiority complex to surface. but it was there, so it eventually did. he was attracted to my femininity and used me to feel more manly about himself (just like how he used short women to feel big in the past) but he was insecure about his masculinity. once i saw that for what it was, the novelty of his height wore off FAST. short men who aren't insecure are more attractive (to me) than LVM who are tall.

and now my biggest error: **i honestly thought i liked OLDER men.** what a nightmare. all along what i was actually attracted to was men who are **CONSISTENT** (older people, in general are more consistent just by default) **and EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT**

hard lesson learned: the type of men who date younger women are not emotionally intelligent at all. in fact, they are the most stunted. they've just taken the manipulation short cut because they're inferior to their peers. they are the worst of the worst. 

my point is this: don't choose men while you're in autopilot. get to know yourself first. you may think you have high standards and that's good enough. but you might need to put in way more work. raising the bar and having standards is a good first step. but keep going. 

write out a list of things you find attractive in men and then sit with it. REALLY examine each one. explain to yourself WHY you find those qualities attractive. this sub preaches a lot about being brutally honest with the word about what you want. but be brutually honest with YOURSELF first. unpack your shit! 

here's a few more examples: 

i used to think i wanted someone with **talent**. now i've learned i just like men who have **hobbies** and interests. 

i used to think i liked men who **spent a lot** on dates. now i know i just wanted a man who **put in effort.**",True,False,False,FemaleDatingStrategy,t5_xaiot,195956,public,confidence,self,"having and defining your own standards is a great first step, but keep going!!! don't stop there.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/q41iu5/having_and_defining_your_own_standards_is_a_great/,some_ads,7.0,

I've known her for years and she's one of my closest friends so neither of us were willing to break our friendship. That solution seemed to be a compromise though because for years there was no whisper of his wife having a problem with it. I went no contact with the rest of the family. 

But this pasts year my friend (his sister) was being cold and distant with me. I attributed it to just life (thinking she was busy or just needed space) for a while until she randomly apologized to me and admitted that her sister in law is extremely bothered by our friendship and it's causing problems in the family. My friend feels like she is in a impossible position and last night she joked about maintaining a ""secret"" friendship with me. But honestly it's not funny to me. I'm not interested in a secret friendship and I'm really hurt by her for even suggesting it. 

But I don't want to ""break up"" our friendship either. At first I was just sad about the situation, but today I got mad and now I can't shake it. I feel like it's cruel and ridiculous for my exes wife to make these demands about how we (adults in our mid/late 20s) live our lives. And I'm hurt that my supposed friend would be willing to discard me for this. It feels like a breach of trust or something. Especially because she kept it private for so long (she's been distancing from me for months now with no explanation until recently). AND she's not even close with her sister in law. They see each other a few times a year and are friendly, but that's about it. 

What is the appropriate action here? Am I seriously expected to just give up my decade long friendship just because I'm an ex? Is this just part of life and break ups?? Is this a normal situation that I'm just naive about? I feel really blindsided and hurt, by everyone honestly. My ex, his wife, my friend, even my exes family.

i've been thinking a lot this past year about beauty. beauty in nature brings me a lot of joy and healing. whenever i'm feeling awful i go to the coast to hike. the waves hitting the cliffside (especially when it's wildflower season) is mesmerizing and healing for me ❤

and i find that feeling in people too. actually, one of my earliest memories of my life is noticing the boy next door to me because his skin basically glowed in the sunlight. i was enamored. 

we're all human, so we all know the feeling. it's lovely to experience beauty. 

so from an early age i started wanting to have beauty myself. i wanted it to be something that i could build and share with the world the way the world shared it with me. my (subconscious) logic was like this: i like seeing beautiful things, so i want to be one myself.

my mistake was one that most of us made. i observed what OTHER people seemed to find beautiful (instead of what i personally liked) and then worked to conform to it. 

i spent most of my adult life in autopilot chasing the male gaze default of beauty that i saw represented everywhere around me. i'm white and thin, which put me ahead in line in the beauty standard ""game"". it was a corruptive feeling because it made me feel like i was ""winning"" (i wasn't). and i became addicted to the validation of it all.

as i got older i was aware that i had become (conventionally) beautiful and yet my ""beauty"" never gave me that magical feeling i was chasing (the genuine feeling of witnessing something truly mesmerizing and powerful) when looking at myself. and i didn't get that feeling when looking at other women who fit the beauty standard either. of course i could see that they were conventionally beautiful. they did it. they won the game. they fit the standard. but it didn't feel wonderful to experience. it felt...bad.

but beauty shouldn't make you feel bad while you're observing it!!! beauty is supposed to be a wonderful feeling when witnessed, whether it's in the mirror or within other people. but i would look at myself or these women and feel mostly negative emotion (insecurity, jealousy, or anxious apathy). at best i might feel accomplished or validated from time to time (the addicting part), but it was fleeting. i never felt overwhelmed with joy or healed the way raw beauty (like the coast) made me feel. 

so a year or so ago i started examining that feeling and had the epiphany that clearly i don't agree with the male gaze or the patriarchal idea of western beauty. i find it boring. pedophilic. racist. nonsensical. so i started getting in touch with myself to find out what i actually find deeply, genuinely beautiful.

so i would see someone with a gorgeous smile while stopped at a red light and i'd pause to appreciate that seeing them smile gave me THAT feeling (witnessing beauty). i would notice that i actually really liked their eye crinkles. (meanwhile i spend so much time on skin care trying to prevent them because men like YOUTH afterall). or i'd notice that the woman who is ringing my groceries was wearing the perfect color for her skin tone. i'd pass by a group of young women lounging in hammocks together and find their aura so lovely.

moments like THAT felt like actual beauty. and it's so different from the ""beauty"" i had been chasing.  

it made me realize that one of the biggest injustices of being in a patriarchal culture is that much of the ancient wisdom and knowledge from women of the past is gone or only exists in whispers. and one of those things that got lost is OUR (women) definition of beauty. think about it, do you REALLY feel inspired and in awe of the stereotypical Instagram model look? do you REALLY look at those women and feel wonder? do they REALLY make you feel the joy in life that beauty inspires? i really don't feel it. it's men's idea of ""beauty"", not mine. 

and men's idea of ""beauty"" is fine. in small doses. but to be overwhelmed and overpowered by it has totally ruined it. now their tastes just seem disingenuous and boring to me. they say it's just biology. and maybe it is. that's fine. i have biological attraction to particular men too, so i get it. but doesn't that get old? it does to me. hip to waist ratios. signals of youth. signs of healthy child rearing. it's boring. it's uninspiring. it's not for me. 

this was a complicated path for me to walk down because conforming to beauty standards has made my experience in the patriarchy easier than it could ever be for a conventionally unattractive woman. i'm not naïve. i know how undeserved my advantage was and how much it awarded me. when you are able to conform the ways i always did, you get the power of perceived competency and good character. you get validated by everyone. and people just ASSUME you're a good person because you fit the look. that's all you have to do. just fit the look. that power can be used to get ahead in life. life is easier if you're pretty. it's a short cut.

but a short cut to where exactly?

all it does it propel you further in line to live in a generic, capitalist patriarchal life. and worse, you attract people who prioritize that shit. so maybe you get the wealthy husband. but does he actually love you and see your unique deep beauty? or does he just love the 'you' that you crafted while under the spell of the male gaze? is the man viewing you through the male gaze really the ultimate ""prize""? is that really where winning the game gets you?

at my most conventionally beautiful phases in life i attracted the WORST people. predators when i was a teenager. misogynists when i leaned in to the Instagram aesthetic, porn addicts when i dressed for the male gaze. 

my biggest life hack toward meeting high value people has been to examine my relationship with beauty and do a complete overhaul. after my exercise of noting what i personally find beautiful in other people for a few months, i started to examine myself and i started to lean in to the things that make me unique. i changed my style to be more true to myself and my own tastes and comfort. i ditched the things that didn't inspire me and prioritized the things i found beautiful without external input.

cannot. recommend. this. enough.

the men and women that i started to attract (including my currernt bf, who has been nothing but wonderful for almost a year now) are high value people whove been liberated from the mainstream and have an appreciation for authenticity, warmth and uniqueness. 

i know it's REALLY hard to break away from the beauty standard rat race. i know how validating it can feel. but i cannot recommend enough that you try examining it and breaking free. 

every woman here, of all kinds of sizes and shapes and features, has a special and unique beauty. embrace what makes you unique, prioritize what YOU find beautiful, and i promise you will attract better men (and women) into your life.

You spend months and maybe years thinking about someone and then one day a switch flips and you don't feel that way anymore? It might not even be anything the person did or said. It's just that one day for whatever reason the feelings just disappear. One day it would make you so happy just to catch a glimpse of this person, the next you are kind of indifferent.

&amp;#x200B;

It's such a mindfuck. Especially if the person treated you badly. It makes you wonder if they've damaged you and now you don't feel anything. I never had am attraction that worked out and every time this happens I just get colder and more jaded. Not just about romance but anything really, sometimes I just don't feel anything and just go through the motions, all I feel is a combination of anger, boredom and indifference. I'm not the type to go out of my way to gratuitously hurt other people but I feel that as I get older the less empathy I feel in general. These unhealthy crushes are one of the only things that lift this boredom and thats not a good thing.

Like, I don't know, more and more I feel that my body is moving and my mouth is talking and my face is making expressions but im somewhere else not really paying attention. Its not in a traumatic dissociative way, im just in autopilot.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think I am depressed but I am not in the healthiest place either. Im working on that but it will still be some time until i see significant changes.

You spend months and maybe years thinking about someone and then one day a switch flips and you don't feel that way anymore? It might not even be anything the person did or said. It's just that one day for whatever reason the feelings just disappear. One day it would make you so happy just to catch a glimpse of this person, the next you are kind of indifferent.

&amp;#x200B;

It's such a mindfuck. Especially if the person treated you badly. It makes you wonder if they've damaged you and now you don't feel anything. I never had am attraction that worked out and every time this happens I just get colder and more jaded. Not just about romance but anything really, sometimes I just don't feel anything and just go through the motions, all I feel is a combination of anger, boredom and indifference. I'm not the type to go out of my way to gratuitously hurt other people but I feel that as I get older the less empathy I feel in general. These unhealthy crushes are one of the only things that lift this boredom and thats not a good thing.

Like, I don't know, more and more I feel that my body is moving and my mouth is talking and my face is making expressions but im somewhere else not really paying attention. Its not in a traumatic dissociative way, im just in autopilot.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think I am depressed but I am not in the healthiest place either. Im working on that but it will still be some time until i see significant changes.

At the beginning of the year, myself (37F) a sort of friend of mine(35F) and one of her sort of friends (50F) started doing an outdoor activity together as a group. 
In the beginning it was easy going, fun, but after a few times I’ve noticed that 50F complimented 35F over the moon and threw some half-ass funny/insulting comments towards me. 

No worries, I thought, maybe she has a bad day, she doesn’t notice she’s a bit of a dick, I won’t sweat it (and yes, it came to my mind as well, that three women can be a bitch-zone). 
It got worse and I didn’t do the outdoors activity with them anymore. I simply said I’m busy one time and after this, I never got an invitation again. 

Now, half a year later, I thought enough time has passed to let things cool down, I asked 50F to join me for a bigger outdoor mission. Why? Because she is fit, I needed company and I didn’t want to leave it at a sour place. 

We had five hours a good time and nothing sour. No bad comments, fun times. 

She then asked me a month later to join her and 35F. I said yes, again, motivated by not leaving things at a sour place. Big mistake!

Not only turned it into complete custard with provocative humour and comments from 50F towards me but when I said, hey, be nice to me, I got shot down by 50F and 35F. 

Like wtf? I’m old enough to know better but what is this???

Has anyone ever felt like second chances are not always a good thing?
Has anyone ever questioned themselves if you’re too sensitive? Or why one gets complimented and the other gets borderline nasty comments?

I am holding myself accountable and was thinking about situations where I might have said provocative things, but I didn’t. The only bad thing I can see is that I was laughing about stupid comments from 50F (to brush them off and be a cool chick) instead of drawing a line.

My life is so much more peaceful, I'm already learning so much about myself. I read a book recommended to me in this thread ""CEO of Everything"" highly recommend to anyone else going through some major life changes. I'm much more confident in my daily life, I have more ambition, and while some things are a learning curve, doing this on my own really reinforced the belief that I am very capable of being independent.
